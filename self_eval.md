# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?

  I am feeling confident in my use of the built-in ruby methods that do not use an argument.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?

  I feeling confident in writing my own simple methods. Having puts in the examples was throwing me off a bit as I thought you HAD to include that. It took me a while to really wrap my head around why we would want
  to write a method that you would not see the output of.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)

  When you are defining a method with arguments, are the terms argument, variable, placeholder, and parameter interchangeable? If not, what is the difference?

  Does the symbol => only mean return value? Or can you use that for output? Specifically, I am wondering for my own personal note taking.

  Storing a return value has been the hardest concept for me to understand so far! Can you define implicit return again? I was not quite grasping the definition listed in the lesson.
